Extensions:

1) Enhance the user's messaging experience by allowing them to "mark as unread",
delete, or archive messages after reading them.

2) Requesting a schedule by day, by time, or all of the events that a user has signed up for to print/download.

3) Replace your text UI with a Graphic User Interface (GUI), which should follow the Model-View-Presenter architecture.
3a) As a group, we also expanded this idea by turning the conference system into an website.
Allows for people to be logged in at the same time.

More Features:

1) Extending the type of event to include VIP only events. This introduces a new type of user, which is a VIP attendee.
